# About this project
I started developping this bot a year ago, after talking with my girlfriend about how you could share characters description as an artist on discord. This was the opportunity to (re) discover SQL database, and discord.py. I put this project on hold due to exam and lack the enthusiasm to continue (I also lost the project). Now I feel more confident tackling this project, espacially thanks to Github and Pycharm. 

# Aknowledgements

I would like to thank AlexFLipnote for the time he took to help me while I was developping this bot. He also provided a very nice quick setup template to create a discord bot on his own Github page and even updated his postgreslite library with async support.
